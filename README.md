# VAE-Anime-Face-Generator
Probabilistic based Generative AI to generate new Anime Faces.

## Description:
***Variational Autoencoders (VAE)*** are powerful **Generative models**, which have fundamentally unique property that separates them from vanilla autoencoders, and it is this property that makes them so useful for generative modeling, their latent spaces are, by design, continuous, allowing easy random sampling and forcing it to be a **Normal Distribution**.

## Dataset: [Anime Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset)
